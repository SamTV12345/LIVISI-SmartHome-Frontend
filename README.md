# Repository for a new updated design for the new local innogy smarthome 

This repository contains a third party ui that can be run on your raspberry pi.
The advantage is that the smarthome (SH) doesn't need to serve the files thus offering better speed. 
The communication is done via the local REST-API


Current features:
- Login and retrieve OAuth2.0 token.
